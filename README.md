## 🎯 Learning Approach

This repository follows a **structured, progressive learning methodology**:

1. **Theory First**: Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Focus on recognizing common patterns and approaches
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build up to advanced concepts
4. **Multiple Languages**: Implementations in both C++ and Python for broader understanding
5. **Practical Application**: Real-world examples and problem-solving frameworks

## 🚀 Getting Started

**For Recursion:**
1. Read through `Recursion/Recursion.md` for the theoretical foundation
2. Practice with the examples in `Recursion.cpp` or `Recursion.py`
3. Follow the 4-week practice progression outlined in the guide

**For Sorting:**
1. Review the data structure prerequisites in `Sorting/SortingStudy.md`
2. Study each sorting algorithm with its complexity analysis
3. Implement and compare different algorithms

**Overall Study Plan:**
1. Use `SelfReview.md` as your roadmap
2. Focus on foundational concepts first
3. Practice implementations in your preferred language
4. Build understanding through progressive complexity

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
